                The real identity of Spiderman is Peter Parker, an orphan being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in
                New York City after
                the death of his parents in a plane crash.

                Peter Parker is an high-school student at Midtown High School. During a science exhibit he is bitten by
                a radioactive spider
                and "acquires the agility and proportionate strength of an arachnid". Along with super strength, Parker
                gains the
                ability to adhere to walls and ceilings. Through his native knack for science, he develops a gadget that
                lets him
                fire adhesive webbing of his own design through small, wrist-mounted barrels.

                Initially, Peter uses these abilities for stardom, but after letting a burglar escape who is responsible
                for shooting his
                uncle, he learns to use his power to fight crime.
